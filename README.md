This package is the foundation layer for all matrix algebra routines needed in software developed for the iOS and OSX platforms from the [DyerLab](https://dyerlab.org).  The motivation herenotion here is to provide an abstraction layer relying as much upon the Swift `Accelerate` framework to allow population genetic and spatial analytic routines to be easily added to any deliverable product.
